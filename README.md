# MOLON Ontology Package

The MOLON Ontology describes mechanisms driving distinct mutational
profiles in cancer.

This package makes it easy to load and visualize the MOLON ontology

## Installation

You can install the development version of the MOLON Ontology Package
from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yourusername/molon")
```

## Quick Start

``` r
library(molon)

# Visualise
graph_ontology()
```

Load the ontology as a data.frame

``` r
load_ontology()
```

    ## 1                 immune system activity is the dominant force driving mutational profile
    ## 2                                   More than 10% of structural variants  are RAG-induced
    ## 3                          Profile contains substantial contributions of APOBEC mutations
    ## 4        Patient has >10% of their profile APOBEC present with APOBEC (kataegis excluded)
    ## 5                 Patient has at least 1 region of kataegis enriched for APOBEC mutations
    ## 6                                                      Patient has both Focal and Diffuse
    ## 7                                                                                        
    ## 8                     A reduced ability to protect sites from, or repair small mismatches
    ## 9                    Profile is dominated by mutation or failure to repair methyl-CpG\xca
    ## 10                                                    Patient has double hit loss of MBD4
    ## 11 High TMB, High SBS1 contribution, moderate model error, mutations in MutS_ (MSH2/MSH6)
    ## 12                                                   High TMB, LOF mutations in MMR genes
    ## 13                                                                              High SBS7
    ## 14                                 Mutational profile derived from genotoxic therapeutics
