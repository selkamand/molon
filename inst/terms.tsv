Term	Parent	Description
ImmuneHijacking	Endogenous	immune system activity is the dominant force driving mutational profile
RAG Hyperactivated	ImmuneHijacking	More than 10% of structural variants  are RAG-induced
APOBEC	ImmuneHijacking	Profile contains substantial contributions of APOBEC mutations
APOBEC (Focal)	APOBEC	Patient has >10% of their profile APOBEC present with APOBEC (kataegis excluded)
APOBEC (Diffuse)	APOBEC	Patient has at least 1 region of kataegis enriched for APOBEC mutations
APOBEC (Multi)	APOBEC	Patient has both Focal and Diffuse
Compromised Repair	Endogenous	
MMRd	Compromised Repair	"A reduced ability to protect sites from, or repair small mismatches"
Methyl-CpG Mutation	MMRd	Profile is dominated by mutation or failure to repair methyl-CpGÊ
MBD4 LOF	Methyl-CpG Mutation	Patient has double hit loss of MBD4
Non-Canonical MMRD	Methyl-CpG Mutation	"High TMB, High SBS1 contribution, moderate model error, mutations in MutS_ (MSH2/MSH6)"
Canonical MMRd	Compromised Repair	"High TMB, LOF mutations in MMR genes"
UV-dominated	Exogenous	High SBS7
Treatment Associated	Exogenous	Mutational profile derived from genotoxic therapeutics
Platinum Chemotherapy	Treatment Associated	> 10% of mutations generated by platinum chemotherapy exposure
Thiopurine Chemotherapy	Treatment Associated	> 10% of mutations generated by thiopurine chemotherapy
Alkylating Chemotherapy	Treatment Associated	> 10% of mutations generated by alkylating chemotherapy
Radiotherapy	Treatment Associated	> 10% of mutations generated by radiotherapy
Uncertain	Other	Mechanism driving the molecular profile is unknown
